#	COMMANDS FROM XTENSION

# every color capable device will send the xtKeyColorMode key with any On or SetValue command. This will
# be equal to either xtKeyColorModeColor if the device should switch to color more or xtKeyColorModeWhite
# if the device should switch to color temperature mode. Obviously if your device can only do one or the other
# then the mode can be ignored for receiving commands from XTension, but should still be included in outgoing commands
# TO XTension so that it's displays know what format to use.
#
# if a device is color capable then with any on or set value command the color values will also be included
# in the command from XTension. Those values will be sent 3 ways, as a standard HTML string format with the key
# xtKeyColor, as a comma separated list of HSV values in the xtKeyColorHSV and lastly as a comma separated list of
# x,y values. These are calculated in XTension and so the color corrections may not be applied the best for your device
# use whichever format is simplest for the device you are talking to.
#
# color temperatures in XTension are always in degrees K. If your device, like phillips hue bulbs, use some other custom range
# of temperatures then you must convert or map the values onto a real K scale when handling commands from XTension or sending
# them to XTension.
# the color temperature will be sent to you and can be sent from you to XTension via the xtKeyColorTemp key
#
# if your device can display colors but cannot display color temfperatures directly XTension will also include a key
# of xtKeyCalculatedColorTemp in any color temperature command. This is a best guess RGB color for the color temperature
# requested. It may need to be adjusted or mapped in order to look at all correct. 
#
# in order to handle any color information or commands the unit must have it's xtKeyAllowColor and/or
# xtKeyColorColorTemp flags set when you create it and in the info.json definition for that unit type
#
# you should send the color mode with every command that includes color data to XTension

# when sending a command to XTension include whichever color format is most convienient and XTension
# will convert to the other types internally.

	# so it might be something like "james.hap.summary" then you must also use that value as
	# the key for a short description of what the settings already are and use the setData command
